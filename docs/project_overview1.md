# ðŸ“˜ Developer Notes â€“ Telematics Insurance Project

## Overview
This proof-of-concept demonstrates an **AI-driven telematics pricing system** that collects simulated driving data, analyzes driver behavior, and calculates risk-based insurance premiums.

The project is organized into:
- **Data simulation & modeling (src/ml)**  
- **API backend with FastAPI (src/api)**  
- **Interactive UI with Streamlit (src/ui)**  

## Key Features
- **Simulated Telematics Data:** Speed, braking, night driving, distance.
- **ML Model:** Linear regression with positive weights ensures monotonicity â€” risk always increases with speed or braking.
- **API:** `/predict` endpoint returns a `risk_score` (0â€“100) and a calculated `premium`.
- **UI:** Streamlit dashboard lets users adjust sliders and instantly see their risk and pricing level.

## Risk Model
- Trained on simulated trip data (5â€“50 drivers Ã— 5â€“50 trips).  
- Factors used:
  - `avg_speed` â€” higher â†’ higher risk.
  - `harsh_brakes` â€” frequent braking â†’ higher risk.
  - `night_drive` â€” Boolean; driving at night adds moderate risk.
  - `distance_miles` â€” small contribution.
- Smoothed thresholds:
  - Safe Driver: <65  
  - Moderate: 65â€“77.9  
  - High Risk: â‰¥78  
- Custom scaling in `pricing.py` makes the risk increase gradually â€” not abruptly.

## Premium Model
- **Base Premium:** \$120  
- **Dynamic Adjustment:**
  - Safe â†’ cheaper  
  - Moderate â†’ base Â± small margin  
  - High â†’ higher premium
- **Corridor:** (0.5â€“1.6) prevents extreme prices.  
- Formula ensures fairness:
